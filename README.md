# Network-Analytics
A network analytics dashboard project  

# üåç IP Location Dashboard

A Python-based dashboard that utilizes the [GeoLite2-City](https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data) database to display geographic information based on IP addresses.

## üöÄ Features

- IP geolocation lookup using MaxMind's GeoLite2 database
- Real-time network traffic analysis and alerting system
- Monitor and visualize packet information such as source/destination IPs, protocols, and data size
- Identifies and alerts on:
  - High traffic volume
  - Unusual protocols
  - Repeated access from suspicious IPs
  - Access from blocked countries
- Geo-location visualization on a world map
- Export packet data to CSV, JSON, or PDF format
- Web-based interface using Streamlit for ease of use
- Clean and extensible Python codebase
- Lightweight and easy to set up
- Can be extended into a web dashboard or analytics pipeline

## üß∞ Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- pip
- GeoLite2-City.mmdb file (from MaxMind)
- Additional dependencies (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

Edit
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the GeoLite2-City.mmdb

Visit: https://dev.maxmind.com/geoip/geolite2-free-geolocation-data

Place the .mmdb file in the root directory of this project.

üìä Usage
Run the dashboard script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python dashboard.py
Features in Action:
Real-Time Network Monitoring: The dashboard continuously captures network traffic and provides insights on packet flow, protocol types, and data size.

Alerts and Notifications: Get notified about high traffic volume, unusual protocols, suspicious IP access, and blocked countries.

Geolocation Mapping: Visualize the source of network traffic using GeoIP mapping, showing the locations of IP addresses on a world map.

Export Data: Export captured network traffic data to CSV, JSON, or PDF formats for further analysis or reporting.

Extend or Modify:
Web-based Frontends: Extend the dashboard to web-based platforms such as Flask or Streamlit.

IP Log Ingestion: Integrate the system with external log files or APIs for enhanced data processing.

Real-time Geolocation Tracking: Implement real-time tracking of network activity with geolocation data.
